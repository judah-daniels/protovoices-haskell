{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

{- | This module contains functions for visualizing derivations using LaTeX and TikZ.
 These functions are generic over slice and transition contents and are thus somewhat limited.
 For protovoice derivations,
 an alternative to plotting a derivation would be to export an 'Analysis' to JSON
 and view it interactively in the
 [protovoice annotation tool](https://dcmlab.github.io/protovoice-annotation-tool/)
 (not implemented yet).

 Plotting happens in two steps.
 First, a the derivation is "replayed" using a (generic or grammar-specific) "player"
 to construct a 'DerivationGraph',
 which contains all graphical objects and their positions explicitly.
 The 'DerivationGraph' can then be plotted using different backends
 (currently only TikZ, but a diagrams/SVG backed would be useful too).
