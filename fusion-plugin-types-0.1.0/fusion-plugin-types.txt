-- | Types for the fusion-plugin package.
--   
--   GHC package that provides types that when used in a package can be
--   identified by the <a>fusion-plugin</a> package to perform any extra
--   optimizations.
@package fusion-plugin-types
@version 0.1.0


module Fusion.Plugin.Types

-- | A GHC annotation to inform the plugin to aggressively inline join
--   points that perform a case match on the constructors of the annotated
--   type. Inlining enables case-of-case transformations that would
--   potentially eliminate the constructors.
--   
--   This annotation is to be used on types whose constructors are known to
--   be involved in case-of-case transformations enabling stream fusion via
--   elimination of those constructors.
--   
--   It is advised to use unique types for intermediate stream state that
--   is to be annotated with <a>Fuse</a>. If the annotated type is also
--   used for some other purpose this annotation may inline code that is
--   not involved in stream fusion and should otherwise not be inlined.
